This page collects a small, non-exhaustive selection of lecture notes developed during my **Master’s thesis** at *Politecnico di Milano*.  
The material shown here is intentionally *redacted* and represents only random excerpts from different courses, shared for documentation and reference purposes rather than as complete study material.

All notes are written in **LaTeX**, with a focus on clarity, mathematical rigour, and engineering relevance.

#### Failure of Metals

Notes covering the mechanical failure of metallic materials, from physical mechanisms to engineering models.  
Topics include **embrittlement**, **fracture mechanics**, **fatigue**, **creep**, and **experimental testing methods**, with emphasis on failure interpretation and model limitations.

#### Materials for Energy

Lecture notes focused on materials challenges in the energy sector, largely structured around failure case studies.  
The material addresses **degradation mechanisms**, **high-temperature behaviour**, and **design constraints** across conventional and renewable energy systems.

#### Mathematical Methods

Theoretical notes supporting continuum mechanics and materials modelling.  
Main topics include **functional spaces**, **distributions**, **Fourier transforms**, and **partial differential equations**, with attention to formalism and physical meaning.
