This page presents a small selection of projects completed during my exchange program in Shanghai.  
They are standard coursework projects, shared mainly for reference and documentation purposes.

Everything here is written in LaTeX; I describe my setup and workflow in a separate article available here: [LaTeX Setup](/latex-setup.md).

#### Modeling the Melting Behaviour of Pure Ni, Zr, and Ni-Zr Alloys

This project explores **melting** and **phase transitions** in **pure Ni**, **Zr**, and selected **Ni-Zr intermetallic compounds** using molecular dynamics simulations (LAMMPS).  
The work was carried out as part of a multiscale materials modelling course and focuses on atomistic-level analysis of thermal behaviour.

#### Understanding Physical Aging and Its Mechanical Characterization

A study on **physical aging** in glassy polymers, focusing on **stress relaxation** and **creep compliance**.  
The project applies viscoelastic theory to both isothermal and non-isothermal aging, highlighting where common modelling assumptions start to break down.

#### Review: Gum-Based Functional Materials

A literature review on **gum-based functional materials**, covering their mechanical, rheological, and functional properties across different application domains.  
The emphasis is on structure-property relationships in soft and bio-based materials.
