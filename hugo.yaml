    title: "About Me"
    # image: "/images/me.png"
    content: |
      I hold a master's degree in **Engineering**, but my professional and personal path has never followed a single, linear track. I have always been **driven by challenges**, especially those that require discipline, curiosity, and the **willingness to step outside my comfort zone**.

      Alongside my academic background, I have pursued **competitive swimming** at an agonistic level, studied **piano** with formal examinations at a conservatory, and continuously tested myself through **mathematics competitions**.  
      I have lived and studied abroad, including experiences in **Australia** and **China**, and completed a **sailing course** with the Italian Navy, each of these shaping the way I approach problems, teamwork, and long-term goals.

      Behind the scenes, I am deeply interested in technology, computer science, personal finance, and, more broadly, any topic that helps me understand systems, patterns, and what lies beyond the immediate horizon (including theology, geopolitics, and strategic games).  
      I value continuous learning and take a disciplined, serious approach to what I do.
